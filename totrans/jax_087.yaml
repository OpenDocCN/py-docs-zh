- en: It is not permitted to manipulate JAX trace values concurrently from multiple
    threads. In other words, while it is permissible to call functions that use JAX
    tracing (e.g., `jit()`) from multiple threads, you must not use threading to manipulate
    JAX values inside the implementation of the function f that is passed to `jit()`.
    The most likely outcome if you do this is a mysterious error from JAX.
