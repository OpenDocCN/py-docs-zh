- en: Ink annotations are used to contain freehand scribbling. A typical example may
    be an image of your signature consisting of first name and last name. Technically
    an ink annotation is implemented as a **list of lists of points**. Each point
    list is regarded as a continuous line connecting the points. Different point lists
    represent independent line segments of the annotation.
