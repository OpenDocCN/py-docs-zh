    "Page.draw_circle")), a requirement may be to have access to predefined colors.

- en: The fabulous GUI package [wxPython](https://wxpython.org/) has a database of
    over 540 predefined RGB colors, which are given more or less memorizable names.
    Among them are not only standard names like “green” or “blue”, but also “turquoise”,
    “skyblue”, and 100 (not only 50 …) shades of “gray”, etc.

    into PyMuPDF and make its colors available as PDF compatible float triples: for
    wxPython’s *(“WHITE”, 255, 255, 255)* we return *(1, 1, 1)*, which can be directly
    used in *color* and *fill* parameters. We also accept any mixed case of “wHiTe”
    to find a color.'
