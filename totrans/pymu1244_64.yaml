- en: The original naming convention for methods and properties has been “camelCase”.
    Since its creation around 2013, a tremendous increase of functionality has happened
    in PyMuPDF – and with it a corresponding increase in classes, methods and properties.
    In too many cases, this has led to non-intuitive, illogical and ugly names, difficult
    to memorize or guess.

- en: A few versions ago, I therefore decided to shift gears and switch to a “snake_cased”
    naming standard. This was a major effort, which needed a step-wise approach. I
    think am done with it now (version 1.18.14).

- en: The following list maps deprecated names to their new versions. For example,
    property `pageCount` became [`page_count`](document.html#Document.page_count "Document.page_count")
    in the [Document](document.html#document) class. There also are less obvious name
    changes, e.g. method `getPNGdata` was renamed to [`tobytes`](document.html#Document.tobytes
    "Document.tobytes") in the [Pixmap](pixmap.html#pixmap) class.

    case) remain untouched.

- en: Old names will remain available as deprecated aliases through MuPDF version
    1.19.0 and **be removed** in the version that follows it - probably version 1.20.0,
    but this depends on upstream decisions (MuPDF).

    like `Deprecation: ''newPage'' removed from class ''Document'' after v1.19.0 -
    use ''new_page''.` when aliased methods are being used. Using a deprecated property
    will not cause this type of warning.'

    show a copy of the original’s docstring, **prefixed** with the deprecation message,

- en: There is a utility script [alias-changer.py](https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF-Utilities/tree/master/alias-changer.py)
    which can be used to do mass-renames in your scripts. It accepts either a single
    file or a folder as argument. If a folder is supplied, all its Python files and
    those of its subfolders are changed. Optionally, backups of the scripts can be
    taken.
