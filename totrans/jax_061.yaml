    one (even if it was for a different project), you probably don’t need to do it

    instance for large refactors or internal rewrites, they may contain several.)
    In preparing a pull request for review, you may need to squash together multiple
    commits. We ask that you do this prior to sending the PR for review if possible.
    The `git rebase -i` command might be useful to this end.  ### Linting and Type-checking'

    covers a range of Python versions, dependency versions, and configuration options.
    It’s normal for these tests to turn up failures that you didn’t catch locally;
    to fix the issues you can push new commits to your branch.

- en: Once your PR has been reviewed, a JAX maintainer will mark it as `Pull Ready`.
    This will trigger a larger set of tests, including tests on GPU and TPU backends
    that are not available via standard GitHub CI. Detailed results of these tests
    are not publicly viewable, but the JAX maintainer assigned to your PR will communicate
    with you regarding any failures these might uncover; it’s not uncommon, for example,
    that numerical tests need different tolerances on TPU than on CPU.
