- en: JAX provides some small, experimental libraries for machine learning. These
    libraries are in part about providing tools and in part about serving as examples
    for how to build such libraries using JAX. Each one is only <300 source lines
    of code, so take a look inside and adapt them as you need!

    generally **will not merge PRs** adding new features. Instead, please send your
    lovely pull requests and design ideas to more fully-featured libraries like [Haiku](https://github.com/deepmind/dm-haiku)
    or [Flax](https://github.com/google/flax).
